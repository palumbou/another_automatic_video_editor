Put your royalty-free / licensed music file here.

Examples:
- track.mp3
- track.wav
- track.m4a

If this folder is empty, the pipeline will generate a simple placeholder “music” track (synthetic sine/noise) to stay copyright-safe,
but it will NOT sound like a real soundtrack.

Tip: for YouTube content, consider using the YouTube Audio Library or other properly licensed sources.
